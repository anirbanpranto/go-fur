# Very random snippets of code

## I warned you, but if you insist to learn something from these codes
Start from the file named
```
barebones.go
```
This file has some comments about things I learned. Basics of variables, constants, functions and control-flow
Next up is probably -
```
usefulConstructs.go (arrays, maps, and library stuff)
designs/pretty.go (methods, interfaces etc. + design patterns)
concurrency.go (exactly what the name implies)
```

Then I plan to move in to learning more advanced concurrency stuff + Gin (Rest APIs + Websockets). Eventually making a few ML-Infra
projects and systems stuff in Go.
